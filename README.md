## Next Task List

Just a little Task list application. Persists your tasks in local storage, so they're there when you visit the app again later! I also threw in a couple of bare-bones automated tests, just for fun.

Check it out here: https://next-task-list-ostaron.vercel.app/

Or, to run locally, clone the repo, install your dependencies, and run `npm run dev`
